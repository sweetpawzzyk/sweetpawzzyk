              <h2>Here are some activities from our staffs during their work hour</h2>
              <p>As a pet sitter, you would be expected to go on a lot of dog walks. Pet parents want their dogs to be walked and some would even expect you to run with the floofs! Get familiar with the neighbourhood before you go on a dog walk so you can safely walk the dog without aggravating them. You can also discuss the dog walking goals with the pet owners beforehand.
                <br> Grooming the pets is also a part of pet care services. This includes brushing their coats, cleaning their teeth, bathing them, trimming their nails, cleaning their ears, etc. One of these tasks also includes cleaning up any accidents and doing waste removal.
                Ideally, socialisation should happen in the first 12 months of a puppy’s life. This is the critical period for learning behaviours and forming habits. However, don’t panic if you have a dog that missed out when they were young. There is still hope for your older dog!
